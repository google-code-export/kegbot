This directory contains mirrors of several open source packages necessary to run
pykeg.  Unless explicitly noted, no modifications have been made; the packages
are simply included out of convenience to kegbot users.

See the README file in each directory for more details on individual packages.

TODO(mikey): Move pykeg to distutils, and gather dependencies that way.
