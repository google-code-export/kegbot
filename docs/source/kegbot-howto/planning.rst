Getting started: Plan your Kegbot
=================================

Your author can guarantee that building your Kegbot will be more fun than doing
that lawn work or taking up knitting.  Your new gizmo will be the life of your
next party, an endless source of new ideas, and just plain nerdy-cool.

However, your author has also seen many eager-eyed metered-beer-lovers get
stalled by mailase, overwhelmed by the steps involved, or put off by
shortcomings in documentation.  This section is an attempt to get you started,
with some tips we've learned along the way.

Common Questions
================

Before we begin, we will answer the most common questions new kegbot builders
often have.

How much will it cost?
----------------------

For the most basic system, you can expect the following primary expenses:

* $0-$1000 -- Refridgerator.  Any fridge large enough to accomodate a keg will
  work; fancy commercial kegerators look nice but cost much more.
* $40 -- Kegboard (Arduino board.)
* $0-$300 -- Linux computer.  You won't need anything fancy, so an old PC or
  laptop installed with your favorite Linux distro will do the trick.
* $50 -- Flow meter.
* $0-$100 -- Flow hardware.


How long will it take to build?
-------------------------------

It should be possible to find and assemble all the parts in a week.  No
guarantees yet, thought: here at Kegbot HQ, we're still learning how to make
things easier for others.


What skills do I need to build one?
-----------------------------------

The minimum skills necessary to build a Kegbot system are:

* **Linux.** You will need to set up and run the Kegbot software on a Linux
  machine.  If you can find an old computer and make Ubuntu run on it, you're
  good to go.
* **Wiring.** You do *not* need to know how to solder, but you will need to
  connect a few signal wires together to get your Kegboard working.  If you know
  how to build Ikea furniture or lego kits, it's the same sort of effort.


Kegerator: A Kegbot Prerequisite
================================

While it is certainly possible to build a Kegbot from scratch, your author
recommends you begin by first building a plain old kegerator: no kegbot, no
special hardware, just a refrigerated beer tap.

Why not build a Kegbot from the get-go?  If you don't already have a kegerator,
you'll want to at least enjoy one keg before you go messing it up.

Seriously though, you won't mess it up, but there's no way around it: adding
Kegbot hardware to your beer's line will make the path the beer takes more
complicated.  An inline flowmeter will cause changes in pressure and other
turbulence that could contribute to problems with your pours.  There are plenty
of ways a new, unmodified kegerator could have flow problems, too; keeping the
kegbot hardware out of the picture will make it easier for you to understand and
tune your new kegerator.

Whether you plan to build a kegerator from an old refridgerator, or buy one off
the shelf, you can find more information in our guide, :ref:`kegerator-howto`.
