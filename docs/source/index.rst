Welcome to Kegbot's documentation!
==================================

This is the central index of official Kegbot documentation.

Several guides have been published; see abridged outlines below, or click on the
document titles for the full document. These documents are also included in the
pykeg software distribution.

Other Resources
===============

Sadly, you may find some of this documentation incomplete. Our apologies! We're
still working on improving and completing the Kegbot documentation.

If the published documentation hasn't solved your issue, you may have luck with
these other Kegbot resources:

**KegBB Forums**
  The `KegBB Forums
  <http://kegbot.org/kegbb/>`_ may or may not
  be a vibrant community for help and exchanging ideas.

**Bug Tracker**
  Please use our `issue tracker <http://code.google.com/p/kegbot/issues/list>`_
  to search for and file new bugs.

**Kegbot wiki**
  The `Kegbot Wiki <http://kegbot.org/wiki>`_ is something of a scratchpad of
  notes and ideas; anyone can add and edit information on the wiki.

  Unlike the official, published docs (which are intended to describe stable
  features and Kegbot releases), the wiki is a place for bleeding-edge notes and
  ideas (some of which may wind up here.)

Documentation Wishlist
======================

Things I would love to have documented but haven't gotten around to:

* Spellcheck the docs :-)
* Allow comments/annotations (similar to django and php project docs)
* Add developer's guide -- submitting patches, python style (or lack thereof),
  etc.
* Describe how to use an OpenWRT box as a kegboard controller.
