Kegboard Overview
=================

History
=======

The Kegboard is the most important device in a kegbot system; a reliable
Kegboard is essential to accurately recording all pour data.

The current Kegboard is based on the popular Arduino AVR development board, and
reflects several improvements from previous designs::

* Onboard in FT232 serial-to-usb converter
* Completely programmable via USB; no special programmer needed
* Plenty of I/O, including two external interrupt pins (pulse counting)
* Free C compiler and large standard library
* Widely available, many cheap clones

In addition to all of the above advantages, we decided to use an Arduino (rather
than rolling our own controller board) simply because it takes a lot of hand
assembly, soldering, and debugging out of building a Kegbot.  You don't need to
be an experienced electrical engineer -- or even own a soldering iron -- to
build a working Kegboard!

Features
========

Primary features of Kegboard include:

* Two independent flow meter inputs (monitor up to two kegs from one board)
* Two controllable relay outputs
* Support for any number of DS1820 temperature sensors
* OneWire bus master dedicated to device detection (use iButtons to authenticate
  to Kegbot through the kegboard)
* Documented protocol (:ref:`kegboard-serial-protocol`) for interfacing with
  software; supported by pykeg
* Easily built from widely-available Arduino board; no hardware programmer
  necessary

A basic kegboard setup includes:

* One Arduino Decimilia (or similar) AVR microcontroller board. This board can
  be purchased for around $30 at `SparkFun <http://www.sparkfun.com>`_.
* (Optional) DS18S20 or DS18B20 temperature sensor(s).
